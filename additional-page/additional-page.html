			<div class="parakn"><p>  This Mountain Range has been aptly named as the Knuckles Mountain Range,
			since it bears resemblance to the knuckles of a 
			clenched fist when viewed from several locations, 
			and was named so by British surveyors after realizing 
			the resemblance. It is also known as Dumbara Kanduvatiya, 
			which means mist laden mountain range. The Knuckles massif 
			is located in central Sri Lanka; in the districts of Matale 
			and Kandy and spreads out over an area of 155 square kilometers.
			It is one of the major eco- tourism spots in the island and 
			is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mountain range is 
			a hotspot among nature and adventure enthusiasts. The five 
			peaks have been named as Kirigalpoththa, Gombaniya, Knuckles,
			Koboneelagala and Dotulugala. It is home to over 40 rural
			villages and is rich in biodiversity. The climate here is
			unpredictable and constantly changing, and the thick fog can 
			cover up the entire area in just a few minutes. 
			The different trails leading to the Knuckles Mountain range, 
			offer splendid and breathtaking vistas. On the way you will
			be able to spot several cascading waterfalls and streams and
			a wide variety of flora and fauna. The differences in vegetation,
			the variety of flora and fauna and the magnificent views makes 
			Knuckles a hikerâ€™s haven."
