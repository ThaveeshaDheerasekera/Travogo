				As an open area full of fields, forests, walking paths 
				and surrounding mountains it is a place loved by visitors who 
				enjoy taking walks in nature or spending a day out in the open.
				Further down south after Ambewela and higher up the mountains is Horton Plains National Park, 
				which includes the breath-taking and famous World’s End. The hiking trails in Horton Plains are top-notch and a must if you like hiking.
				World’s End is a drop-off at the edge of a huge cliff at the end of the Horton Plains plateau."<br>-copied-</p>

				and definitely worth a visit.Also consisting of the legendary Hakgala Botanical Gardens which are wildly believed
